Important: Only modify the cells which instruct you to modify them - leave \"do not modify\" cells alone.  \n\nThe code which tests your responses assumes you have run the startup/read-only code exactly.\n\n### 2. Work through the notebook in order.\n\nSome of the steps depend on previous, so you'll want to move through the notebook in order.\n\n### 3. It is okay to use libraries.\n\nYou may find some questions are fairly straightforward to answer using built-in library functions.  That's totally okay - part of the point of these exercises is to familiarize you with the commonly used functions.\n\n### 4. Seek help if stuck\n\nIf you get stuck, don't worry!  You can either review the videos/notebooks from this week, ask in the course forums, or look to the solutions for the correct answer.  BUT, be careful about looking to the solutions too quickly.
